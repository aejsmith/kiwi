config SLAB_STATS
	bool "Slab allocator statistics"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra statistics in the slab allocator. This is not enabled by
	  default as it causes a slight performance hit - the statistics are
	  modified using atomic operations which are serialising instructions.

config DEBUGGER_DELAY
	int "Time to wait for debugger connection"
	default 0
	help
	  If not 0, this option adds a delay in the kernel initialisation
	  process which allows time, for example, for GDB to be connected to
	  QEMU.

config PAGE_DEBUG
	bool "Physical memory debug output"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug output in the physical memory manager. Be warned
	  that this will write a debug message on every page allocation and
	  deallocation.

config KMEM_DEBUG
	bool "Kernel memory allocator debug output"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug output from the kernel virtual memory allocator.

config SLAB_DEBUG
	bool "Slab allocator debug output"
	default n
	help
	  Enable extra debug output from the slab allocator.

config CACHE_DEBUG
	bool "Page cache debug output"
	default n
	help
	  Enable debug output from the page cache.

config IPC_DEBUG
	bool "IPC debug output"
	default n

	  Enable debug output from the IPC code.
