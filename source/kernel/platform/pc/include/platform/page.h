 * Free page list number definitions.
 *
 * On the PC, we split into 3 lists: below 16MB (for ISA DMA), below 4GB (for
 * devices needing 32-bit DMA addresses) and the rest. Since the page allocator
 * will search the lists from lowest index to highest, we place over 4GB first,
 * then below 4GB, then 16MB. This means that wherever possible allocations
 * will be made from higher regions, making allocations from the lower regions
 * when they are actually required more likely to succeed.
