/**
 * @file
 * @brief               AMD64 time handling functions.
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - Handle systems where the TSC is not invariant. We should use the HPET or
 *    PIT on such systems.
 *  - Because I'm lazy this is only microsecond resolution at the moment. Doing
 *    nanosecond resolution requires some fixed point maths fun. Something along
 *    the lines of:
 *        cv_factor = (cpu_freq << 32) / ns_per_sec;
 *        time = (tsc << 32) / ns_per_sec;
 *    The problem with this, however, is that you lose the top 32 bits of the
 *    TSC, which is really not very useful.
